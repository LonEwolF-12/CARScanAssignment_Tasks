# CARScanAssignment_Tasks
This is a project on car parts visualization and a car damage classifier. It is divided into two tasks(visualization and damage classifier). In the first task, points of car parts were given, and I needed to visualize the details using OpenCV; after identifying, I gave that label to the car part. In the second task, I was given some training and test examples; for that, I had to create a binary classifier if the car was damaged or not. For the modeling, I have used CNN with a good score.
